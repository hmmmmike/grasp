Grasp is a trace visualization tool. To run the Grasp tool simply run the "grasp" executable. It will show a dialogue allowing you to chose a trace file.

The example/ directory contains three example traces. The basic_explained.log trace contains an explanation of the Grasp trace file format and introduces the basic Grasp events. You can view it in a text editor. Note that it is a proper trace, so you can open it with Grasp too.


Running Grasp
=============

Grasp is written in Tcl. The main .vfs directory follows the structure of a tclkit, so the easiest way to run grasp is to:

1. download a tclkit binary from
     
     http://code.google.com/p/tclkit or http://equi4.com/pub/tk/downloads.html
     
2. place it in the directory containing grasp.vfs

3. run from a terminal: 

     tclkit grasp.vfs/main.tcl


Command line options
====================

Grasp also provides a command line interface. Usage:

  grasp ?options? <log file>

options:
--settings file      : file name of the settings file to override the default
                       visualisation settings, such as colors and dimensions of
                       tasks.
                       
--postscript file    : if this option is specified, then the plot will be
                       written to the postscript file with the given file name
                       
--plugins 'path path ...' :
                       file name of the tcl script, which is going to perform
                       analysis on the trace
                       
--ignore list        : list of strings 'string string ...' to be ignored. All
                       tasks and servers with an id containing any these strings
                       will not be shown. (Default '')
                       
--ignore_missing bool :
                       boolean (i.e. 0 or 1) specifying whether to ignore
                       unimplemented Plot events. (Default 1)
                       
--legend side        : where to print a legend. Has to be either 'none', 'right'
                       or 'bottom'. (Default 'none')
                       
--legend_items list  : list of strings 'string string ...' specifying the legend
                       items to print in the legend. The proper legend items
                       are: taskActive, taskHoldingMutex, taskPreempted. (
                       Default 'taskActive taskHoldingMutex taskPreempted
                       taskArrived')
                       
--ignore_api bool    : boolean (i.e. 0 or 1) specifying whether to enable the '
                       ignore' command in the trace files (if 0 then the 'ignore
                       ' command has no effect).
                       
--exit bool          : boolean (i.e. 0 or 1) specifying whether to quit grasp
                       after it has plotted the trace. This option can be useful
                       if grasp is used in batch processing of many traces.

To display the available options you can run the following command from a terminal:

  tclkit grasp.vfs/main.tcl --h
